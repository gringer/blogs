# So You Want to Be a Freelance Bioinformatician

Every now and then, I get asked for advice on being a freelance
bioinformatician: someone working (at least part time) in a
sole-trader business as a bioinformatician. To get the most important
point across first, I don't do it for the money (as is the case with
many other freelance jobs). More explicitly, the freelance part of my
work has almost never been the entirety of my work, and when it has
I've sometimes had to go for a few months without a source of
income. It's very easy to get underworked (or, for that matter,
overworked), and a sizeable financial buffer has been important in
keeping me and my family up and running.

## What is Bioinformatics

I see bioinformatics as the process, or art, of converting research
outputs into something that can be better understood by other
researchers. Research outputs that typically, but not always, involve
very large datasets.  One of my favourite explanations of
bioinformatics is that it’s a bit like surfing: chasing waves of
information from an ocean of data, and presenting them in an
interesting way before they reach the shore of public knowledge.

I feel like I need to learn something new for every bioinformatics
project that I take part in. This seems so intrinsic to
bioinformatics, that I'm tempted to argue that a project only includes
bioinformatics if it's breaking new ground somewhere (this is almost
always the case with research anyway). I can't help but parallel this
with the somewhat snobbish definition of artificial intelligence that
we were told during computer science lectures: if lay people can
understand it, it's not artificial intelligence.

## The Beginning

I occasionally get asked about when it all started. I summarise the
beginning of my research side in a presentation about my life as a
Māori genetics researcher
[here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308026084_The_Maori_Difference_Exploring_the_life_of_a_Maori_genetics_researcher)
[[talk script](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308026087_Talk_script_for_presentation_2016-Sep-09)]. Some
of the text in this post is pulled from that presentation.

But in truth my desire to look at things, see how they work, and
change them started in my childhood.

### A BASIC Start

Our family got our first computer when I was 8 years old. For those
that care, it was a 286 XT, it had a VGA screen, a 20MB hard drive and
a “turbo” button. The hard drive meant that we could store different
applications on the computer. Games as well.

One thing that my dad realised fairly early on was that the user
interface of the system was a bit lacking. It was DOS, completely
command-line driven, with a mechanical process of changing into a
directory and typing in the command required to run the program. So,
he created a BASIC program to display a menu of games and
applications, and complemented it with batch files to run the
applications.

Over time, we got more games, and the menu system started to need a
bit of fixing. Dad showed me the source code for the menu program and
pointed out the lines that needed changing. Without having any
understanding of program code at all, I was able to hack the program
and make user interface changes. It was wonderful! I played quite a
few games in my childhood on the 286, including Railroad Tycoon,
Carrier Command, Populous, Jack Nicklaus Golf and Hero's Quest: So You
Want to Be a Hero.

Our computer was upgraded to a 386, which brought with it the
possibility of playing games with better graphics and larger worlds:
Civilisation, Monkey Island 2, Space Quest 5 (among others). I learnt
to suffer through long loading screens and slow gameplay so that I
could just bearably play, Doom, Master of Magic, and One Must Fall. I
was also introduced to a memory sniffing program called Game Wizard
that allowed me to cheat when playing computer games.

### Pascal's Triangle

When I was about 14, an experimental programming course was introduced
at Wellington High School. We started off learning a language called
Logo, and wrote programs that controlled a little triangle as it moved
across the screen. Later on in the course, we were introduced to the
Pascal programming language, I discovered that the compiler we were
using had comprehensive help files with example code, and my interest
in programming exploded.

I flitted between BASIC and Pascal on various computers at school,
with my main interest being in writing screensaver-like programs. I
also did a bit of tinkering with save game files, and messing around
with different binary file formats. I wrote some visualisation code to
pull out world maps from Civilisation save game files, and discovered
the encryption format of the Warheads save game files (a simple
`255-x` operation), allowing me to create my own weapon editor for
that game. I loved tinkering with things, and programming opened up a
whole new world of possibilities in that regard.

### The Mathematics of Genetics

In the meantime, I was studying maths and biology at school. For full
disclosure, my 7th form [year 13] subjects were Biology, Chemistry,
Physics, Calculus, Japanese, and Photography.

I was introduced to genetics via Mendel and punnet squares. I learnt
subsequently at a conference that Mendel is one of the worst ways to
introduce genetics, but it worked well for me because maths was one of
my favourite subjects, and I found a comfortable familiarity in the
punnet squares and binomial frequencies.

My biology teacher in my last year at high school,


My biology grades were low; I was a just-passing C student. I didn't
have a head for rote learning, couldn't write good essays, and my mind
is easily twisted into knots by binary comparisons (like "purines" and
"pyrimidines"). However, my teacher at the time,
[Joan Hinton](http://www.whs.school.nz/weeklywrapup/weekly-wrap-up-term-4-week-8/),
curiously recommended that I should consider a career in genetics.

Once I was in a position to decide on university subjects, the advice
was enough to nudge me away from my best high-school subject (physics)
and towards my worst (biology). This decision was the beginning of a
realisation that I could improve myself better by working on my
weaknesses rather than my strengths.
