I am an [eLife ambassador](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/912b0679/early-career-advisory-group-elife-welcomes-150-ambassadors-of-good-practice-in-science) for open research, but am also a strong advocate for free software. I've previously written up [a post](open-research.html) about the links between open research and free software, and would recommend reading that to understand why I think free software is important for good research.

# What is Free and Open Source Software?

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is software that gives the *users* of that software the freedom to do anything they want with the software. A proper definition of what is required to give this freedom [is complicated](http://gplv3.fsf.org/rms-why.html), but those complications are mostly about how free software is *distributed* to other people. If a person just wants to *use* free software, they probably don't need to be concerned about those issues.

# What is Free and Open Source Software?

Isn't that the same question?

Well... yes. But my answer is different.

The answer I just gave was something of a dictionary definition, but here I give a practical definition: a definition by demonstration. It is my hope that by demonstrating the wide range of free software that is available, I can better show what it is.

All the software that I present here is available on at least the three major classes of operating systems: Windows, OSX, and Linux. All these software programs also have code available for download that can be inspected, so that curious people can see exactly how it works.

The programs are broken up into rough categories, with a bit of a blurb about each program (once I get around to writing them) and links to the program websites for downloading the programs. Note that the descriptions here are frequently paraphrased from multiple sources (including other tweets and software web pages).

Playing such a presentation consists in a series of translations, zooms and rotations that allow to focus on the elements you want to show.

## **Graphics**

Inkscape is a vector graphics editor for diagrams, icons, and logos. Inkscape opens Adobe Illustrator and PDF files, to edit them, facilitating transitioning away from the expensive subscription-based Adobe tools. It is outstanding software for manuscript figures and scientific posters. Inkscape is trivial to use as a point-and-click program, yet also has a comprehensive scripting ability.

### OpenSCAD

http://www.openscad.org/

OpenSCAD is a programmatic 3D modeler for creating solid 3D CAD objects (for 3D printing and animation). OpenSCAD has helped me a lot for my various 3D-printing adventures. I think my most complex object so far would be a [vaccuum filter device](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2341007) for helping me to filter river water from the local stream for subsequent nanopore sequencing.

### Enigma

http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/

Enigma is a top-down marble labyrinth / memory game.

A marble game? Is that all?

Well, yes, but it's got a tetris simulator as one of the puzzles that you need to solve to advance through the game. It's surprising how many different worlds can be created from a fragile marble and a bit of imagination.

## **Other**

Have I forgotten something? Do you want to know more?

# Summary

For most of the computer things people want to do in their everyday life, those things can be done using free and open source software. The gaps are getting filled as more people use free software, and the landscape of free software is improving all the time.

An important thing to remember is that most of the developers of free software are creating software on a voluntary basis. Be nice to them, use their programs, support them, and encourage them, because they are helping to create the future.
